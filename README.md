## My process

### Built with

- [react](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [styled-components](https://styled-components.com/) - For styles
- [keen-slider](https://keen-slider.io/) - For the slider

### What I learned

I implemented `keen-slider` for the first time and it seems smooth and clean. I also made for the first time an `:active` ripple-like button animation. It was a bit challenging making this responsive for all devices but it was a joy!
